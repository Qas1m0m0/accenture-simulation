*Task 3: Software Development Methodologies: Waterfall and Agile*

- [x] Understand the Waterfall and Agile methods of software development, including how they originated and their advantages and disadvantages

*Waterfall*

- A project management approach that emphasizes a linear progression from beginning to end of a project. This methodology, often used by engineers, is front-loaded to rely on careful planning, detailed documentation, and consecutive execution

**Advantages**
-Work planning and budget forecasts can be relatively accurate even over a span of years
-Process is straightforward, relatively simple, easily communicated, and doesn’t require training in mindset or process to use it
-Teams that for some reason cannot work closely together or operate with shared responsibility can still collectively accomplish the project with well-documented outputs from each phase as input to the next
-Its very easy to know how far along a project is, who is responsible at each stage, what “done” looks like, and when “done” will occur

**Disadvantages**

-Small tasks or details unfinished in one phase can hold up the whole process
-Cumbersome and expensive to respond to significant changes in scope or design (which are inevitable over a project lasting months, let alone years)
-Each phase and its corresponding team are relatively disconnected from the others, with the customers (whose needs are ostensibly driving the design and functionality of the software) as far removed as possible from the requirements definition and design phases where their input is most needed
-Large documentation overhead drives up cost and delivery time

*Agile*

- The whole development cycle to be iterative, incremental, and collaborative with shared responsibility, rather than one-time-through and sequential.
In this model, software is broken down into smaller sets of functionality, each of which is then designed, built, tested, and released in repeating waves or “sprints” in direct collaboration with the customer, who has input into each of those sprints, all along the development cycle. 

The Agile implementation of the SDLC follows four key values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

With this idea of repeating waves of development and release of working software, Agile introduced a new concept for software development: the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP is the version of the product that has just enough working features and functionality to satisfy a customer need and collect maximum information about customer opinion and satisfaction with the least invested effort. By managing your Agile process to build the MVP first, you validate both your understanding of customer needs and the viability of the software with the least cost and the least risk, before iterating the process to add additional functionality.

**Advantages**

-Designed with change in mind. Changes to scope and design are expected and easily accommodated by the process
-Easy and quick to pivot based on changing customer feedback
-Useful value is delivered frequently and repeatedly throughout the lifecycle, starting with delivering the MVP
-Faster to production deployment than with waterfall, with a generally lower overall risk profile and a higher ROI

**Disadvantages**

-Can get too responsive to frequent changes, with too much input from the customer. A good balance must be maintained
-Requires training team members and customers to best implement and utilise the Agile mindset and Agile cultural work processes
-Requires strong communication and teamwork skills to be effective
-Less effective if the customer does not want to be a direct and active member of the team






*Task 4: The Software Testing Lifecycle*

- [x] Develop understanding of the Software Testing Lifecycle(STLC) and its advantages and disadvantages
- [x] Understand advantages and disadvantages of automated testing


The Software Testing Lifecycle(STLC) is a conceptual framework desribing activities involved in process to ensure software doeswhat it is designed to do, without defects - assurance is called validation.

Stages of STLC:

1. Requirement Anlaysis: What functionality needs to be tested? How can the wuality of the software be validated?
2. Test Planning: Develop testing plan for unit, integratio, system and user acceptance tests.
3. Test Design: Develop test cases, test scripts and test data. 
4. Test environment setup: Build + configure hardware and software environment used to conduct testing.
5. Test Execution: Conduct testing using the test cases, and test scripts if automated testing is being employed. Unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests are performed during the relevant stages of the development lifecycle. Communicate defects back to the development team. Retest once defects have been corrected.
6. Test Closeout: Complete all retests as needed. Analyse defect metrics and test results to document software quality.  Prepare and deliver final validation documentation as needed. Communicate insights that can be used to improve the overall development process.

Other benefits of this structured lifecycle approach to testing include:

-A systematic quality process that is repeatable, measurable, and continuously improvable
-Defects can be identified earlier in the development cycle
-Security issues can be identified earlier in the development cycle
-Lower maintenance costs
-Higher client/customer satisfaction
-More stable and consistent system performance

*Unit tests*: A code-level check, performed by members of the development team, to see if individual components of code are working correctly.
Integration tests: Tests of the connectivity and data transfer between unit tested code components or other integration points in the system. Also often done by the development team, but could also be done by a QA team.
*System tests*: Also known as end-to-end testing, system tests are conducted to test the completed, fully integrated software application from a technical point of view, checking that each input leads to the correct output. Often done by a QA testing team at the end of each release cycle. Often referred to as SIT (system integration testing).
*Acceptance tests*: Tests performed by a QA team or a team of representative end users from the client to test the usability and functionality from the end user’s perspective.   Often referred to as UAT (user acceptance testing). Usually the last step before deployment to production and go-live.
*Regression tests*: Systematic retesting of functionality that might have been affected by a modification made to other code to verify no unintended effects of the change. Usually performed by whoever did SIT or UAT testing.


Automated Testing

Automated testing uses software to execute test scripts to test functionality, speed and stability under load, transport and transformation of data, and any other aspects of the system that can be tested without human intervention.

**Advantages**

-Faster to execute testing
-Can perform many test script in parallel
-Faster to production deployment
-Less expensive at scale
-Run unattened 24/7

**Disadvantages**

-More expensive upfront
-Complex technical infrastructure to maintain
-Requires technical/coding skills to configure and operate
-Doesn't catch usability issues
