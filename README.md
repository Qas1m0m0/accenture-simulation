*Task 2: The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- [x] Learn about the history of the SDLC
- [x] How to implement the SDLC framework

-SDLC: Conceptual framework and process model for describing all the activities involved in a process to create, eliver and maintain high quality software.
-The goal of the SDLC is to produce highest quality software at lowest cost and shortes time possible.

Stages in SDLC:

1. Requirements gathering/ extraction and analysis: What does the software need to do? How does it need to dod it? What other systems will integrate? 
2. Planning: What tools or software platforms will be needed to build, test and host software? What is project plan? Duration of it? Cost? Who's working on it?
3. Design: What is the data model for the software application? How architected? What UI looks like? 
4. Building/coding: Write code for application.
5. Testing
6. Deployment: In a production environment.
7. Operation: Monitor use of software. Plan improvements if needed.
8. Support/Maintenance

Implementation of SDLC framework:

Iterative and repeating manner, as info system modified, expanded, integrated as business needs and tech changes.
Agile methodology: reduce the handoffs between stages and teams by bringing users and stakeholders of the software application “inside” the development process, particularly the design, build, and test stages. 

A recent trend in software development methodologies is the “DevOps” trend, which takes the idea of reducing handoffs between stages even further: the incorporation of operations (“Ops”) and maintenance into the earlier stages of the development (“Dev”) cycle. DevOps seeks to improve usability, relevance, maintainability, and security of the software application through shared responsibility across the lifecycle and the automation of software code versioning, testing, packaging, releasing, configuring, deployment, and operational monitoring.
